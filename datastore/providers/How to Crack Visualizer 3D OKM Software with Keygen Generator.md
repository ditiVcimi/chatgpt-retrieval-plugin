However, Visualizer 3D OKM is not a free software. You need to purchase a license key to activate it and use all its features. If you don't want to spend money on the software, you can try to crack it using a keygen generator. A keygen generator is a program that creates random serial numbers that can be used to register a software. However, cracking a software is illegal and may harm your computer with viruses or malware. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse this method.
 
If you still want to proceed with cracking Visualizer 3D OKM, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the Visualizer 3D OKM software from the official website: [https://www.okmdetectors.com/products/visualizer-3d/](https://www.okmdetectors.com/products/visualizer-3d/)
2. Install the software on your computer and run it.
3. When prompted to enter the license key, click on "Cancel".
4. Download the keygen generator from this link: [https://bit.ly/3nKX8Q9](https://bit.ly/3nKX8Q9)
5. Run the keygen generator and click on "Generate".
6. Copy the generated serial number and paste it into the Visualizer 3D OKM software.
7. Click on "OK" and enjoy the cracked software.

Visualizer 3D OKM software has many features that make it a useful tool for 3D modeling and analysis. You can import data from various devices, such as OKM metal detectors, ground penetrating radars, magnetometers, and GPS. You can also create your own data sets using the manual mode. The software allows you to adjust the color, brightness, contrast, and transparency of the 3D models. You can also rotate, zoom, and move the models to view them from different angles. You can measure distances, areas, and volumes of the objects and structures. You can also add labels, notes, and symbols to the models. You can export the models as images or videos, or print them out.
 
Visualizer 3D OKM software is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 operating systems. It requires a minimum of 1 GB RAM, 100 MB free disk space, and a graphics card with OpenGL support. The software is available in English, German, French, Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Greek languages. You can download a free demo version of the software from the official website to test its functionality. However, the demo version has some limitations, such as a reduced data size and a watermark on the models.
 
If you want to use the full version of Visualizer 3D OKM software, you need to purchase a license key from the official website or from an authorized dealer. The price of the license key depends on the type of device you want to use with the software. For example, if you want to use the software with an OKM metal detector, you need to buy a license key for that specific device. The license key is valid for one computer only. If you want to use the software on another computer, you need to buy another license key or transfer the existing one.
